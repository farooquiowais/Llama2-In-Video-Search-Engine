# ðŸ¦™ YouTube In-Video Search Engine

This Streamlit-based application is a powerful tool for searching and analyzing transcripts from YouTube videos. By integrating advanced NLP techniques and leveraging the Llama-2 model from Hugging Face, along with Torch, Langchain, and the YouTube Transcript API, it offers a comprehensive approach to processing and querying video transcripts. Additionally, the application utilizes VectorDB for storing and indexing transcripts and implements simple Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for enhanced query understanding and response generation.

## Features

- **Transcript Extraction**: Extract transcripts from YouTube videos using the YouTube Transcript API.
- **Transcript Indexing**: Utilize VectorDB to store and index transcripts for efficient querying.
- **Advanced Query Processing**: Implement the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for improved natural language understanding and response generation.
- **Llama-2 Model Integration**: Leverage the Llama-2 model from Hugging Face for robust NLP capabilities.
- **Interactive User Interface**: Streamlit-based UI for easy input of YouTube URLs and search queries.
